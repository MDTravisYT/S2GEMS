Each source file in this directory is compiled to a different executable.

I hope you can figure out how to compile individual .cpp files without needing me to provide you with a makefile.

The compiler I used was GCC 3.4.


splitrom.cpp -> splitrom.exe
fixheader.cpp -> fixheader.exe
fixpointer.cpp -> fixpointer.exe
s2p2bin.cpp + KensSaxComp/S-Compressor.cpp -> s2p2bin.exe
